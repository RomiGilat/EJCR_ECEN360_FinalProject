1. Finish DataCamp Notebook
2. Convert all SQL cells to be Python-friendly (this uses SQLite so some code conversion may be required) 
     
      !pip install pandasql
      from pandasql import sqldf
      
      # Load data into DataFrame
      loan_df = pd.read_csv('loan_data.csv')
      
      # Define SQL query
      query = '''
              SELECT column1, column2, ...
              FROM loan_df
              WHERE condition;
              '''
      
      # Execute SQL query
      result_df = sqldf(query, locals())
      
      # Display query result
      print(result_df)

3. Finalize build for Docker (package dependencies - is able to currently launch the Jupyter Notebook) 
4. Make sure all cells in Jupyter Notebook run properly in the Docker volume
5. Make Docker Image on DockerHub
6. Very thorough GitHub instructions
