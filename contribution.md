# Contribution Report

## Collaboration
The majority of this project was collaborative, particularly corresponding to the Jupyter Notebook and making
the graphs and analysis. Individual roles are discussed below, but keep in mind majority contribution was on the
actual graphs and analysis itself and everyone contributed fairly. 

## Case Alexander
Case was responsible for data cleaning and making sure all of the data was correct. Since a lot of the data did not
need to be cleaned, Case was also responsible for some additional graph analysis. 

## Jack Campbell
Jack was responsible for discussing the data/reporting on results and did the majority (other than allocated to Case) of
the graph analysis. 

## Erin Gehle
Erin was responsible for creating the Docker image on Docker Hub (as well as creating the Dockerfile on the GitHub).

## Romi Gilat
Romi was responsible for creating the instructions for the GitHub to be able to access the notebook in Docker Desktop, summarizing the project and ensuring it runs properly.
