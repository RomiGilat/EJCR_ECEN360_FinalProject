# Contribution Report

## Collaboration
The majority of this project was collaborative, particularly corresponding to the Jupyter Notebook and making
the graphs and analysis. 

## Case Alexander
Case was responsible for data cleaning and making sure all of the data was correct. Since a lot of the data did not
need to be cleaned, Case was also responsible for some additional graph analysis. 

## Jack Campbell
Jack was responsible for discussing the data/reporting on results and did the majority (other than allocated to Case) of
the graph analysis. 

## Erin Gehle
Erin was responsible for creating the Docker image on Docker Hub (as well as creating the Dockerfile on the GitHub).

## Romi Gilat
Romi was responsible for creating the instructions for the GitHub to be able to access the notebook in Docker Desktop.
